The goal of the game is the same as SSB, send your opponent off-screen more than they do to you - this scores a point. A game is won when 3 points are scored (i.e. the opponent loses their 3 lives). You can use both melee and projectile attacks to attack your opponent. You will start the game by choosing a stage, then both players will take turns choosing a character.

Controls and Features
You can move using WASD and the Arrow keys, and each player is able to double jump - player 1 is bound to WASD while player 2 is bound to arrow keys.
Each player has a shield, melee, projectile, and ultimate attack (bound to "z","x","c","v" and "n","m",",",".", respectively). However, the ultimate attack can only be used once you pass 100%. This game follows an HP system similar to that of SSB, where you can only lose a life to falling offscreen; however, every 1 hp you take increases the damage and knockback you take by 1%.
